# RITA - User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

This document outlines the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) cases for the RITA Pre-Trade Risk Analysis Prototype. The purpose of these tests is to verify that the application meets the business requirements and functions correctly from an end-user's perspective.

## Test Cases

| Test Case ID | Test Scenario          | Action Steps                                                              | Expected Result                                                                                                                              |
|--------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **UAT-01**   | **Minor Risk Increase**| 1. Launch the application. <br> 2. Use the default base portfolio. <br> 3. In the "Proposed Trade" section, enter Ticker: `GOOG`, Quantity: `5`. <br> 4. Click "Calculate Pre-Trade Risk". | The application calculates the New Portfolio VaR. The new VaR is slightly higher than the Current VaR, but the increase is within the 10% tolerance. A "Go!" recommendation is displayed. |
| **UAT-02**   | **Major Risk Increase**| 1. Launch the application. <br> 2. Use the default base portfolio. <br> 3. In the "Proposed Trade" section, enter Ticker: `TSLA`, Quantity: `50`. <br> 4. Click "Calculate Pre-Trade Risk". | The application calculates the New Portfolio VaR. The new VaR is significantly higher than the Current VaR, and the increase exceeds the 10% tolerance. A "No-Go!" recommendation is displayed. |
| **UAT-03**   | **Risk-Reducing Trade**| 1. Launch the application. <br> 2. Use the default base portfolio. <br> 3. In the "Proposed Trade" section, enter Ticker: `AGG`, Quantity: `100` (adding a bond ETF). <br> 4. Click "Calculate Pre-Trade Risk". | The application calculates the New Portfolio VaR. The new VaR is lower than the Current VaR. A "Go!" recommendation is displayed, indicating the trade reduces risk through diversification. |
| **UAT-04**   | **Data Visualization** | 1. Launch the application. <br> 2. Perform any calculation by clicking the "Calculate Pre-Trade Risk" button. | Two histograms are displayed under "Simulated Profit/Loss Distribution". Both charts render correctly, showing a distribution of simulated profits and losses around zero. |
| **UAT-05**   | **Invalid Ticker Input**| 1. Launch the application. <br> 2. In the "Proposed Trade" section, enter Ticker: `INVALIDTICKER`, Quantity: `10`. <br> 3. Click "Calculate Pre-Trade Risk". | The application handles the error gracefully. The metrics will likely show no change or a warning will be printed in the console/terminal. The application does not crash. The "New Portfolio" metrics will reflect a value calculated without the invalid ticker. |
